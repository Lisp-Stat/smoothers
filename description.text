Smoothing is a relatively large field and includes many techniques.  Wikipedia says:

"In statistics and image processing, to smooth a data set is to create an approximating function that attempts to capture important patterns in the data, while leaving out noise or other fine-scale structures/rapid phenomena."

A great number of the techniques require linear algebra, and thus a dependency on Lisp Linear Algebra (LLA).  For these this reason smoothers is an independent system.
